1. There was an early game in the 2000s that was called create your pocket emo. It would give you an avatar and you can customize it however you like by giving it new clothes, accessories, and objects. Then the avatar would save. In this project we will strive to recreate this game, except with an emo girl.

**Functions**
2 a, Load in the avatar
  b, Customize the avatar 
  c. Save the avatar
3. If you are doing a group project, the list of group members with both their real names and Github usernames.

4 a & b. If you are doing a group project, very brief statements (1-2 sentences each) describing:
How work will be divided (assigned and tracked) among group members, and;
How (and how often!) team members will communicate with each other about the project (such as weekly meetings, ongoing group chat, etc.)
We live in the same dorm hall so we can meet with eachother whenever. We will help eachother write the code, but we will split the work to make it even. Any work done in the code can be labeled by the person with a note.
